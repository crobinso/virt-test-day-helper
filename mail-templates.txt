Hey all,

The Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ Virt Test Day is this coming ZZZDATEZZZ. Check out the test day landing page:

ZZZLINKZZZ

If you're interested in trying out some new virt functionality, there's step by step instructions for:

* ZZZFEATURESZZZ

Even if you aren't interested in testing new features, we still need you! The test day is the perfect time to make sure your virt workflow is working fine on Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ, as there will be several developers on hand to answer any questions, help with debugging, provide patches, etc. No requirement to run through test cases on the wiki, just show up and let us know what works (or breaks).

And to be clear, while it is preferred that you have a physical machine running Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ, participating in the test day does NOT require it: you can test the latest virt bits on the latest Fedora release courtesy of the virt-preview repo. For more details, as well as easy instructions on updating to Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ, see:

ZZZLINKZZZ#What.27s_needed_to_test

If you can't make the date of the test day, adding test case results to the wiki anytime next week is fine as well. Though if you do plan on showing up to the test day, add your name to the participant list on the wiki, and when the day arrives, pop into #fedora-test-day on freenode and give us a shout!

Thanks,
Cole

SUB: Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ Virt Test Day is ZZZDATEZZZ, how you can help
TO: eng-virt-staff-list

CC: libvirt-qe@redhat.com

Hey all,

The Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ Virt Test Day is ZZZDATEZZZ. Here's the landing page:

ZZZLINKZZZ

It would really help if folks could spare 1-2 hours to bang on your specific area of virt expertise with the stock Fedora packages. Particularly if you already have setups for involved things like migration, device assignment, snapshots, etc. No obligation to fill out test results in the wiki, just make sure bugs are filed :)

There's documentation for all the different ways you can setup Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ for testing:

ZZZLINKZZZ#What.27s_needed_to_test

In order of increasing complexity:

- Install Fedora in a VM with nested virt.

- Run Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ packages on latest Fedora release with the virt-preview repo.

- Actually install Fedora ZZZFEDZZZ.

Helping out isn't limited to actually running test cases, just showing up in the IRC channel to answer questions is useful too. I think a strong developer presence is a good way to encourage test day participation from community folks.

If you plan on helping out, please do the following:

- Add your name and IRC nick to the 'Who's available' section on the landing page.

- On the test day, jump in #fedora-test-day on freenode and drop a greeting
  like 'hey all, just stopping in for the virt test day. I work on XYZ so if
  you've got any questions, ask away!'

And this message isn't aimed solely at qemu/kvm/libvirt devs, this (mostly) applies to you libvirt, virt-tools, spice, virtio win, QE and manager types too!

Thanks,
Cole
